# Machine-Learning-120-Years-of-Olympics-History
 The dataset includes information about athletes, sports events, countries, medals won, and various other attributes. By applying machine learning techniques, we aimed to uncover patterns, correlations, and predictive models related to athletes' performance and success in the Olympics.

Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Sex: Indicates the gender of the athlete (male or female).

Age: Represents the age of the athlete.

Height: Specifies the height of the athlete.

Weight: Indicates the weight of the athlete.

Team: Represents the country or team the athlete represents.

Year: Specifies the year in which the Olympics event took place.

Season: Indicates the season of the Olympics event (Summer or Winter).

Sport: Represents the sport in which the athlete participated.

Event: Specifies the specific event within the sport.

Medal: Indicates the type of medal won by the athlete (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or no medal).


Analysis Techniques

The project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Olympics dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The following techniques are employed:

1)Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data. Feature engineering techniques may be used to derive additional relevant information.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset. Key trends, patterns, and relationships between variables are identified and analyzed.

3)Feature Selection and Engineering: The most relevant features are selected based on their impact on athletes' performance and success. New features may be derived from the existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.

4)Model Training and Evaluation: Machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression are implemented to predict and classify various aspects of the Olympics data. Models are trained, tuned, and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.

5)Predictive Analysis: The trained models are utilized to make predictions on unseen data, allowing for the forecasting of athletes' performance, medal outcomes, or other aspects of interest.
